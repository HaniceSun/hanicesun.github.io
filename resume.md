## Projects

### Splicing-mediated transcript fusion and oncogene activation in multiple cancers

- Designed the project to explore splicing-mediated gene fusion events in cancer patients.

- Reanalyzed both whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-Seq data from over 10,000 patients across 33 cancer types from the TCGA project using a negative binomial-based generalized linear model.

- Discovered significant correlations between somatic mutations and the splicing of adjacent genes (transcript fusion), including the recurrent tumor-specific CDKN1A-RAB44 hit in bladder, stomach, and skin cancers.

- Lead the collaboration with other labs to validate the finding using CRISPR/Cas9 editing, RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, qPCR, RNA-Seq, and phenotyping assays.

- Analyzed the data, interpreted the results, and prepared the manuscript. Proposed a splicing-mediated readthrough stabilization (SRS) model as a novel mechanism for oncogene activation.

### RNA-binding protein RBM20-deficient dilated cardiomyopathy

- Identified a suspicious missense mutation in RBM20 via linkage analysis in a family affected by dilated cardiomyopathy through analyzing whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data.

- Collaborated with colleagues to validate the mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 editing in human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and differentiating them into cardiomyocytes.

- Identified splicing targets of RBM20 using RNA-Seq data from humans and pigs given that RBM20 is an RNA-binding protein.

- By applying drug repositioning strategy in thousands of compounds from the Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project, we nominated retinoic acid and cardiac glycoside that may potentially rescue the phenotype.

- By integrating gene expression data from thousands of tissues in the The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, I proposed a model for the tissue-specific splicing of a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, IMMT, suggesting a molecular link between energy supply deficiencies and dilated cardiomyopathy.

### Mutation and regulatory elements underlying neonatal diabetes

- Identified a suspicious intronic mutation in neonatal diabetes by analyzing whole genome sequencing (WGS) and array-based genotyping data from mice.

- Collaborated with colleagues to successfully validate that the mutation is causing diabetes by introducing it into both B6 and NOD mice using CRISPR/Cas9 editing.

- Proposed a mechanism where the mutation creates a novel splice site, resulting in a longer transcript but truncated protein, which has been verified as well by RT-PCR.

- Working with bulk and single-cell data (scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq) throughout development to investigate potential extra regulatory elements and understand why the phenotype is specific to pancreas.

- Working on large-scale QTL mapping (eQTL, caQTL, and pQTL) on multiomics datasets of human islets to study the genetic architecture of diabetes.

### Applying machine learning/deep learning in omics data

- Applied machine learning models (Random Forrest, XGBoost, SVM, etc.) to predict ancestry from genotyping data.

- Developed deep learning models (CNN, ResNet, GPT, Llama2) in predicting selenocysteine and tissue-specific splicing from DNA sequences.
